mergeSort_quickSort_comparison: 
A Java project that "races" Merge Sort and Quick Sort for a random number array (size entered by the user). 
The two algorithms sort the array 20 times. The speeds are compared (nanoseconds) and the winner of the set of runs is displayed. 
This project was designed to explore the practical applications of both sorts. Both sorts are theoretically O(nlogn), however, 
Merge Sort's space complexity is far greater than Quick Sort, making Quick Sort significantly faster on machines.
